Experiment in turning opensimulator + CoolViewer into a game engine.
Opensimulator and CoolViewer (Lindenlab SL based viewer) Are both Opensource technologies to deploy and explore collaborative 3D VirtualWorlds.
These technologies already has the potential to create games so the idea of this project is to hack the viewer and server in order to have a potential solution that allows to distribute out of the box games.
