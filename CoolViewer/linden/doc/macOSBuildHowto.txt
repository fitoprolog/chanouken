A.- Requirements

To build on macOS you need Xcode 11 (get it from the App store or the Apple
developer site) and therefore macOS Catalina (the target system/SDK is set
by the viewer build scripts to v10.9, so the resulting viewer binary should
nonetheless be compatible with OS X Mavericks or newer Mac systems).
It should also build with Xcode 12 (with some more link-time warnings due to
a few badly targetted libraries built by Linden Lab).
You additionally need CMake, in order to create the Xcode project files.
You can install it with the DMG donwloaded from: https://cmake.org/download/
IMPORTANT: cmake v3.12.0 is the *minimum* cmake version required for buidling
with Xcode 10 or newer. CMake v3.16+ is recommended for a faster compilation.
Also make sure to run:
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
in order to get the command line cmake to be properly installed.


B.- Building

To build a viewer release (x86, 64 bits only) from the sources:

1.- Extract the viewer sources from the tarball.
2.- Open a terminal.
3.- Change to the linden/ directory.
4.- Type: ./macos-prebuild.sh
5.- Launch Xcode and open the project:
	linden/build-darwin-x86_64/CoolVLViewer.xcodeproj
6.- In the Xcode window that opened on the CoolVLViewer project, look on the
    left of the title bar and check that the active scheme is reading either:
    "ALL_BUILD > My Mac" or "viewer > My Mac" (if not, click on it and change
    it for one of those).
7.- Build the viewer from the menu bar "Product" -> "Build For" -> "Running".
8.- Cross your fingers...

With some luck (did you properly cross your fingers ?), you should find the
resulting, ready to run "Cool VL Viewer.app" in the following directory:
linden/build-darwin-x86_64/
